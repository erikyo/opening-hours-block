# 🕒 Opening Hours – WordPress Gutenberg Block

**Opening Hours** is a custom Gutenberg block that allows you to easily display and manage the opening hours of a business from the WordPress editor.

---

## ✨ Features

- Define opening and closing times for each day of the week
- Support for two time slots per day (e.g. morning and afternoon)
- Option to mark days or individual time slots as closed
- Toggle between **"Today"** or **"Full Week"** display modes
- Automatically highlight the current day
- Optionally show when the store will open next (e.g. _"Opens Tuesday in 1 day and 3 hours"_)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

From the block settings sidebar, you can:

- Set the **view mode** (Today / Week)
- Enter the **opening hours** for each day using native time inputs
- Mark individual time slots or entire days as closed
- Define default fallback times

On the frontend, the block displays the current or weekly schedule dynamically, including a helpful notice for the next opening time if the store is currently closed.
